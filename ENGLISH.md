Markdown is a simple markup language originally created by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz. Markdown converts your text into valid HTML. Markdown is often used to format README files, to write messages in online discussion forums and to create rich text using a simple text editor.

## markdown - how do use it?
> It's quite simple, the file needs to end in .md, so when you see a file ending in .md it's definitely a markdown file! When this comes to use on GitHub, you can create a README.md.

## markdown - let's write it down!
### Stylizing text or words.
> Make **text** bold. - by adding "**" or "__" in the beginning of the text and in the end\
> Make *text* italic - by adding "*" or "_" in the beginning of the text and in the end\
> Make ~~text~~ crossed out - by adding "~~" in the beginning of the text and in the end\
> Make ``text`` code - by adding "``" in the beginning of the text and in the end\
> Make ```code``` - by adding ``` in the beginning of your code and in the end
```
print('Hello world')
```

>[!NOTE]
> If you add the name of the language after the three inverted commas (```), the code inside them will be formatted according to that language.

### Headings or titles, just use “#”!
If you add just one tic-tac-toe (#), it will be the main title (level 1), i.e. it will be the largest title visually. If you add two tic-tac-toe games (##), this will create a secondary level title (level 2), which will be smaller visually than the level 1 title. The levels continue from the number of tic-tac-toe games that are added, with each level being visually smaller than the previous one.

>[!WARNING]
> Although the titles become visually smaller as you add more tic-tac-toe, this doesn't mean that you can manipulate the sizes in this way. Generally, [CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)](https://github.com/ReisLeonardo/html-css/blob/main/css.md) are used to stylize and manipulate size and appearance in markup languages.

### Lines above and/or below titles/headings, just type --- or *** (above or below)
***

### Making a list.
> 1. Hi! - Use a number and then add a dot(.) without using any spaces
> * Hi! - Use a asterisk or - to make a list like this
> - [X] Make my bed - Use - [X] to make a list like this 
> - [ ] Study a language - Use -[] to make a list like this

### Adding images and creating links:
To add an image or create an e-mail address. Simply drag/attach the image to the repository or type it in (don't upload very large images).

>[!NOTE]
> Note that the only difference is that the images have an exclamation mark, while the links don't!
