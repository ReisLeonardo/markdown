# markdown.md - what is it?
Markdown is a simple markup language originally created by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz. Markdown converts your text into valid HTML. Markdown is often used to format README files, to write messages in online discussion forums and to create rich text using a simple text editor.

## markdown - how do use it?
> Files have endings (e.g: .xls, .pdf, .png) and the markdown ending is "__.md__", so whenever you see a __.md__ file it is written in markdown! When it comes to Github usage, you must create a repository first and then add files with **.md** endings.

## markdown - let's code!
### To make your text look bold, italic, crossed out or look like a code with a background you must add prefixs and suffixs to determinate the area that you to convey. (you can use them mixed as well!)
> Make **text** bold. - by adding "**" or "__" in the beginning of the text and in the end\
> Make *text* italic - by adding "*" or "_" in the beginning of the text and in the end\
> Make ~~text~~ crossed out - by adding "~~" in the beginning of the text and in the end\
> Make ``text`` code - by adding "``" in the beginning of the text and in the end\
> Make ```code``` - by adding ``` in the beginning of your code and in the end
```
print('Hello world')
```

### To make titles or headings or use # for it!
> If you add only "#" it will be or main heading, in other words it'll be the biggest text of your .md file\
> If you add one more "##" it'll be your lower level of heading, in other words it will be smaller than the level using only "#".

### To make lines above or below the headings use --- or ***
***

### Making a list.
> 1. Hi! - Use a number and then add a dot(.) without using any spaces
> * Hi! - Use a asterisk or - to make a list like this
> - [X] Make my bed - Use - [X] to make a list like this 
> - [ ] Study a language - Use -[] to make a list like this

### Adding images and creating links:
To add an image or create a link. Adding an image is not hard you can just drag it to your file or comment and it will be instantly converted (don't drag images that are too big).\

Notice that the only difference between images and links is the exclamation point in the beginning.
